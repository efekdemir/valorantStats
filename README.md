- Delivered a functioning web app with 3 teammates comprising visualizations for a Valorant player database through the use of the D3.js library, which lets users understand how top Valorant players perform and play the game

- Focused on the development of the Player Chart, which displays the top players in a circular layout by using force simulation

- Implemented the filtering functionality and linked interactions with other views where users click a player on the Player Chart, which filters the other visualizations according to the selected player

- Augmented UX by incorporating a tooltip which provides additional information for a given player upon mouse hover
